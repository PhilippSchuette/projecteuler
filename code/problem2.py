# Project Euler Problem 1 Solution
#
# Problem statement:
# Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding
# the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10
# terms will be:
#
# 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
#
# By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values
# do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
