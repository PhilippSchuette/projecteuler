// Problem 4:
// A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
// Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
//
// problem 4 solver is implemented in solver4.go with a unit test in solver_test4.go
