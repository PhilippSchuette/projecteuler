# Project Euler Problem 6 Solution
#
# Problem statement:
# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
# 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385. The square of the sum of the
# first ten natural numbers is (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025.
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the
# first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
# one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
#
# Solution description:
# Simple algebraic manipulations show, that the required sum equals
# 2*1*(2 + 3 + ... + n) + 2*2*(3 + 4 + 5 + ... + n) + 2*3*...
# This approach is implemented directly as a function with n as input.
# For some further utility, the function also takes another input m with
# default value m = 1, which determines the starting point for the summation.
