/* Project Euler Problem 13 Solution
 *
 * Problem statement:
 * Work out the first ten digits of the sum of the following one-
 * hundred 50-digit numbers (see inputs/problem013.in).
 *
 * Solution description:
 * Since Python ints use arbitrary precision we can just sum up all
 * the numbers without worrying about integer overflow. When arbitrary
 * precision is no available, one would probably have to use long
 * division.
