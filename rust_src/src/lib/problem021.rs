/* Project Euler Problem 21 Solution
 *
 * Problem statement:
 * Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n
 * (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n). If
 * d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an
 * amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable
 * numbers. For example, the proper divisors of 220 are
 * 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore
 * d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71
 * and 142; so d(284) = 220. Evaluate the sum of all the
 * amicable numbers under 10000.
 *
 * Solution description:
 * Brute-force.
