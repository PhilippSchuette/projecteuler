/* Project Euler Problem 22 Solution
 *
 * Problem statement:
 * Using problem022.in, a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first
 * names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out
 * the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its
 * alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score. For example,
 * when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth
 * 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would
 * obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714. What is the total of all the name
 * scores in the file?
 *
 * Solution description:
 * Brute-force.
