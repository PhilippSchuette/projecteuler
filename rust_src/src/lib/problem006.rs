/* Project Euler Problem 6 Solution
 *
 * Problem statement:
 * The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
 * 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385. The square of the sum of the
 * first ten natural numbers is (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025.
 * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the
 * first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
 * Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
 * one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
 *
 * Solution description:
 * Brute-force.
